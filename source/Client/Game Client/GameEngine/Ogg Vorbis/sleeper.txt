TSleeper is a simple little component that you can use to easily implement
delays in Delphi. It encapsulates a TTimer component and handles the
necessary details to allow you to delay your application in a "Windows-
friendly" manner.

To use TSleeper, drop one on a form. You can set the Interval property at
design time, if you wish, or at run time. As with TTimer, the interval is
given in units of milliseconds. To go to sleep, call

 Sleeper1.Sleep;

(assuming that your TSleeper component is named Sleeper1). You can also use
the SleepFor method, which combines setting the Interval and going to sleep
in a single method call. For example,

 Sleeper1.SleepFor(2000);

will cause your application to go to sleep for two seconds, and also set the
Interval to 2000.

Note that TSleeper uses a Windows timer, and timer messages are low-priority.
Therefore, you should consider the Interval to be the minimum time that your
application will go to sleep.

By default, TSleeper is installed on the "Pandion" page of your component
palette. You can move it to any other page using the Palette page of the
Options|Preferences dialog.
